    <h1>Triptych Paradigm</h1>
    <p class="post">
When most people think about software engineering, they usually think of coding. This is perhaps because it seems esoteric and mysterious to non-programmers and is the most fun and rewarding part for programmers. 
<br><br>
When we wrote our first programs we most likely focused on just writing code and hacking at it until it compiles and runs. For larger projects, it is necessary to follow a more thorough process that is detailed in the “Triptych Paradigm”
<br><br>
The Triptych Paradigm divides the software development process into three main areas:<br><br>
1.  Domain description<br>
2.  Requirements prescription<br>
3.  Software design
<br><br>
As you can see, the actual coding and software design takes only a fraction of the process. The rest of the process emphasizes taking time to understand the problem instead of just diving in blindly. It is expected that once the descriptive parts of the project are thorough enough, writing the code should be a simple and straightforward job.
<br><br>
There are two main reasons why this process might be more beneficial:<br><br>
1.  Working in a large team: For large teams where it is not simply one or two software engineers but tens of engineers, it is necessary to form a collective idea and focus of the project.<br><br>
2.  Working on critical systems: On projects where security and safety are critical, such as life sustaining systems or working with sensitive information, it is even more necessary to ensure the program is free of bugs that would have great consequences.
