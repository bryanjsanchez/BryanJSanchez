    <h1>How Amazon Web Services Uses Formal Methods</h1>
    <p class="post">
      Engineers at Amazon Web Services use formal methods such as TLA+ to find bugs in their system design that would otherwise be hard to find. Amazon has to manage complexity in their systems in order to safeguard their customer’s data. This includes creating fault-tolerant distributed algorithms for replication, consistency, concurrency control, auto-scaling, load balancing and other coordination tasks. Formal methods find bugs that cannot be found by any other known technique. This is due to human’s inability to estimate the probability of rare combination of events when the system is operating at the scale of millions of requests per second. Usually, bugs are due to errors in design, since code usually implements the intended design. Testing the code is inadequate for finding subtle errors and this is where formal methods come in. 
      <br><br>
      Formal methods are helpful for two reasons. The developer is forced to think deeper and more clearly and also tools can be applied to check for errors in the design. This is in contrast to other design methods such as static diagrams, vague prose and untestable pseudocode. TLA+ is a formal specification language based on basic set theory and predicates. Tools like the TLC model checker can take a TLA+ specification and exhaustively check the correctness across all possible execution traces.
      <br><br>
      TLA+ allows engineers to write code in a language called PlusCal which is closer to C-style programming. At the push a button, this code is then translated into TLA+. 
      <br><br>
      The natural path engineers take when designing software is thinking about the “happy case” were no error takes place. This is understandable as this is probably the most common case. After that, they will think of what could go wrong and test their code against uncommon cases. There are so many combinations of events that it is impossible for any engineer to test for, or even imagine, every possible case. 
      <br><br>
      The two properties that define correctness are safety and liveliness. Safety is what the system is allowed to do and liveliness is what it must eventually do. 
      <br><br>
      Formal methods are not only useful for creating software, it also remains useful throughout its lifetime. It allows engineers to test whether changes and optimizations are safe to implement. It also allows future engineers to create a mental model of the system in a more accurate way than ambiguous prose documentation, reading complex code and talking to other engineers. In contrast, formal specification is short and precise.
