I would like to give my two cents on what was discussed in class and by another class member about an inconsistency in the example from the book. 
One of the restrictions in the "Inner-city Street System" analysis is that it is not possible for traffic to go in circles. However, there is no restriction in place to prevent this. As was mentioned, it is possible to connect the end of street 1 with the end of street 2 and the end of street 2 with the end of street 1 without violating any restrictions. 
<br><br>
What I get from this is that this is a perfect example of how the software development cycle works. David Lorge Parnas said "Software engineering is defined as the multi-person construction of multi-version software. 
<br><br>
It is evident from the example that this is simply a rough sketch of an analysis document, however it is necessary to start somewhere. According to the triptych paradigm, software development is a cyclical process where you iterate many times over the various steps required to effectively develop software. If the process was not very thorough, it is possible that this software is released without taking this error into consideration. Later on, the software engineers are able to return to the domain description, requirements prescription or software design phase as needed to correct this and release a subsequent corrected version. 
<br><br>
While it is indeed necessary to be as thorough as possible, I feel like it is also important to understand that the process will not be perfect on the first attempt. If we try to undertake this impossible task from the very start it is possible that we might not make much progress out of fear of not being complete.
