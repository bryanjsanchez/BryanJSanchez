    <h1>Petri Nets</h1>
    <p class="post">
Petri nets are used to depict systems that are composed of a set of states and transitions. Each state can transition into another state as long as certain pre- and post-conditions are held. In a petri net diagram, circles represent conditions, rectangles represent events and arrows represent transitions. In order to mark a condition as satisfied, tokens are used inside the circles. Weighted conditions and arrows can be used when more than one resource is shared. Petri nets are useful when studying issues of concurrency, resource sharing and starvation. 
<br><br>
A classic example of a problem that can be represented using a petri net is the “Dining Philosophers” problem. In this example, a certain number of philosophers are sitting around a table and an equal number of chopsticks is placed on the table. One chopstick is placed between each philosopher. When a philosopher gets hungry, he must pick up the chopstick to either side. The philosopher to either side must then wait until that philosopher is finished eating before he or she can use the chopstick. This example helps us understand resource sharing and various concepts related to concurrency.
